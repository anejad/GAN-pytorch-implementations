- Basic GAN (folder: 1_basic_GAN):
  - Based on classic paper by Goodfellow et. al 2014: [Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661). 
  - Feed forward dense GAN structure 

- Deep Convolutional GAN (folder: 2_DCGAN):
  - based on :  Radford, et al 2015 - [Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434)
  - Conv GAN structure
